 hanza_redline_war: "Legacy of the Hanza-Redline War"
 hanza_redline_war_desc: "The bloodiest conflict the entire Metro has seen since the apocalypse. The war was fought between the §YHanseatic League§!, and the §BAnti-Communist Coalition§! as a means to surpress the ever growing might and power of the §RSokolnicheskaya§! Line. The war quickly devolved into utter carnage; back and forth engagements, guerilla warfare, Entire stations and tunnels littered with towers of corpses. One side would take control of a station, only for them to be pushed back later that very same day. Slowly the war grew tiresome, exhausting the metro of resources and its population. Citizens of both sides grew agitated and exhausted from the war. It was clear that neither side would achieve victory. Whilst the true victor can be argued to be the §YHanza§! - as their interests to contain the §RRed Line§! and completely subjugate the §YKoltsevaya line§! was achieved, it is clear to see the scars of that horrific conflict still permeates the denizens of the metro.\n\n It will take a while before our citizens are willing to join the military."

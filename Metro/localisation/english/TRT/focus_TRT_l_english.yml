 TRT_big_happenings_in_little_venice_desc: "Venice sits on a island surrounded by dark waters. A haven for scumbags and a refuge for crime, but many consider it a haven and their home.

 TRT_shooting_range: "Shooting Range"
 TRT_shooting_range_desc: "Yobs strutting around expecting to be embroiled into conflict is surely a powder keg waiting to innevitably burst.

Those who don't want to be under the iron boot of tyranny are seeking to packup and flee elsewhere. Why not convince them to take refuge at Venice?"

 TRT_armed_to_the_teeth: "Armed to the Teeth"

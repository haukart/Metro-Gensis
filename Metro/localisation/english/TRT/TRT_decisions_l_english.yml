 TRT_flooding_issue_desc: "Our Bandit issues are the least of our worries. §YVenice§! didn't get its name magically out of thin air, but from the fact that our the streets are flooded. As snow and ice accumilates during the winter months, and thus thaws during the summer sesaon, the water pours into the tunnels below. Flooding our stations even more every season.\n\n\nWe may prepare extensive measures and brace for further flooding, but we will ultimately be at the mercy of the seasons until we can either navigate the bulk of water to someplace else. Or fix the tunnel infrastructure.\n\n  Predicted Severity: [?Root.TRT_preparedness_requirement|H0]                                                           Current Preparedness:  [?TRT_preparedness|H0]\n\nWe also have the issue of dealing with Mutated shrimp which infest dark, warm bodies of water. Swarming underground rivers and bringing much strife to our trade fleets.\n\n   Shrimp Infestation: [?TRT_flooding_shrimp_problems|0R%%]\n"

  RED_state_of_the_line_desc: "Whilst disasterous for all participants. The ripples from Hanza-Redline war can be felt more sternly within the Red Line. Andreys dreams of a unified Metro - crushed.

  RED_assume_kulak_property_desc: "Providing our citizens with economic rebates, especially aimed towards our agriculturalists will inject a much needed economic surplus into our economy. With added independence however, it has been a growing concern that some of our farmers may indeed be too better for their own good. Farmers who have already begun selling 'too much' grain.

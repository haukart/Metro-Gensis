  ### Rail Technologies ###
  0: rail_folder:0 "Rail Draisines"
  1: rail_folder_desc:0 "The Research & Production of Rail vehicles used wage war."
  2: rail_panzer_explosive_shell:0 "Explosive Shells"
  3: rail_panzer_explosive_shell_desc:0 "As opposed to purely kinetic ammunition, explosive shells use a chemical payload to create an explosion on or around the target, this is especially useful for coming up against armored targets."
  4: rail_cart_mounted_emplacement_tech:0 "Mounted Emplacement"
  5: rail_cart_mounted_emplacement_tech_desc:0 "Adding machine guns, or even small cannons to swivel mounts on railcarts will make it much easier to fire at targets while on the move."
  6: rail_panzer_sloped_armor_tech:0 "Sloped Armor"
  7: rail_panzer_sloped_armor_tech_desc:0 "Steeply angled armor on railcarts and Panzers can effectively deflect stronger munitions than armor mounted at flat angle."
  8: rail_reinforced_chassis:0 "Reinforced Chassis"
  9: rail_reinforced_chassis_desc:0 "Further reinforcement of the chassis the railcarts use will allow for more weight in either cargo, armor, or armament."
  10: rail_panzer_periscope:0 "Periscope"
  11: rail_panzer_periscope_desc:0 "Giving the commander of a Panzer a periscope allows him to have a 360 degree view around the tank, without having to open the hatch."
  12:
    - rail_military_vehicle_salvaging_desc:0 "Pre-War Military vehicles (Well maintained ones, anyway) were made out of highly durable parts, some of which can be re-purposed on railcarts."
  13:
    - rail_industrial_vehicle_salvaging_desc:0 "Industrial Trains and other mobile construction equipment was built to do work under load, meaning the components involved are perfect for the stresses of the Metro."
  14:
    - rail_improved_fuel_storage_desc:0 "Storing cans of fuel in easily opened compartments shielded from gunfire means that fuel is always on hand, and never lost to combat before the cart itself."
  15:
    - rail_fuel_storage_desc:0 "Storing racks of fuel in jerry cans and other containers on the cart will extend their range and reduce their burden on the supply chain."
  16:
    - rail_cart_storage_compartment_desc:0 "It is necessary for rail mounted troops to have ample storage on carts for their belongings and any equipment not in use."
  17:
    - rail_cart_jurry_rigged_handcrank_desc:0 "While labor intensive, and not very fast, two person hand cranks can move carts faster than earlier designs."
  18: rail_cart_durable_chassis:0 "Durable Chassis"
  rail_cart_durable_chassis_desc: "Rail Chassis made of durable material can absorb more punishment, and carry more weight."
  19:
    - rail_car_reinforced_rollers_desc:0 "Reinforcing the rolling wheels under rail vehicles reduces the chance of derailment and allows us to put more pressure on them."
  20:
    - rail_car_mounted_ammo_box_desc:0 "Safely stored, easily accessible ammo increases both the longevity and combat effectiveness of rail vehicles."
  21: rail_automobile_salvaging:0 "Automobile Salvaging"
  22: rail_automobile_salvaging_desc:0 "Pre-War cars can be salvaged for useful components like engines, fuel tanks, and even bodywork when better armor isn't available."
  23:
    - rail_armor_plating_desc:0 "Armor plated in overlapping layers instead of one large piece of metal increases the protection of the cart across the board."
  24: rail_car_turret:0 "Rotating Turret"
  25: rail_car_turret_desc:0 "Having a turret that can fire in any direction is necessary for the development of rail tanks and turret cars."
  26:
    - rail_cart_mounted_emplacement_tech_2_desc:0 "Adding gun shields and cover to weapon emplacements will make them safer to use, and thusly deadlier on the battlefield.
  27: rail_plough:0 "Mounted Plough"
  28: rail_plough_desc:0 "Cart mounted ploughs will make clearing light debris off the railroad both easier, and quicker, allowing carts to break through tougher terrain."
  29:
    - rail_car_wiremesh_front_desc:0 "Wiremesh Windows are more resistant to attacks from mutants and ambushes than either glass or open air."
  30: rail_improved_fuel_storage_2:0 "Large Fuel Storage Containers"
  31: rail_improved_fuel_storage_2_desc:0 "Increasing the volume of fuel stored means even less need for constant deliveries from the logistical corps."
  32: rail_reinforced_hull:0 "Reinforced Hull"
  33: rail_reinforced_hull_desc:0 "Using stronger materials on the hulls of rail vehicles will increase their general durability."
